It uses phrases such as ""I not accept"", ""I not believe"", and ""I not do"" to emphasize the speaker\'s disconnection from the migrants\' experiences and perspectives. The language also reduces migrants to mere objects or concepts, using phrases like ""we not have indicator"", ""we not have relation"", and ""we not have plan"". Additionally, the language is devoid of emotional language, empathy, or personal connections, which further contributes to the dehumanizing nature of the text.\n\nHowever, the language does not contain extreme dehumanizing elements, such as comparisons to animals or insects, or explicit diminishment of humanity.

The use of words like ""none"", ""nobody"", and ""nothing"" further reinforces this dehumanizing effect, suggesting that migrants are invisible, insignificant, and lacking in agency.\n\nThe language also employs a tone of resignation and powerlessness, which can be seen as a form of dehumanization, as it implies that migrants are unable to effect change or influence their circumstances.
